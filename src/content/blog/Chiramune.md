Sinopsis: Saku Chitose is a popular, outgoing, and successful high school student – a "riajuu" (a person who is fulfilled in real life). The story follows his perspective as he navigates his social life and the lives of those around him, including a group of friends and classmates who are not as socially adept. The novel is known for its realistic portrayal of high school life, its focus on character development, and its exploration of social dynamics and the pressures of popularity. It's more of a character-driven slice-of-life with romantic elements than a pure romance.
